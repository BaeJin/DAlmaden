For travel it is way too big and heavy. I also liked the various settings for the heat and blower. Unfortunately there isn't many useful ones. The cool setting and the cool shot button are exactly the same temperature and the warm is only a little warmer. The most useful setting is hot with low blower or hot with high blower. If you are looking for a light weight travel dryer that doesn't take up tons of room in suitcase don't get this one.

It worked very well! I m super particular about my dryer and usually pack my t3 dryer (a brand I ve used for 12 years). Sadly my normal dryer wasn t compatible abroad.

I have not used it outside of the US so I do not know how this would work. Does not say 60/50 Hz so I do not know if this would work in the country with 50 Hz. Now, the air blow is VERY weak. Just like the one in some of the hotel uses. I guess the smaller the dryer, the weak it is. My wife's dryer is about twice as large and blows lots of hot air. But since this blower is for traveling so I shouldn't be complaining. Hope this works in the country with 50 Hz."

Full-sized dryers tend to be too big and heavy for me, and this product is the perfect size and weight. I was worried that it might be a compact size like other travel dryers, but It s more of what I d call medium sized.Some more pros:- The folding feature allows it to be neatly stored without taking up too much space.- I LOVE the multiple settings: cool, warm, hot for temperature and off, low, high for power. I use it on a warm on high setting according to the instructions that came in the box, and am able to style my hair perfectly every time.- This dryer is supposed to adjust the voltage automatically so you don t have to. (I ve only used it on 110v so far and as soon as I turned it on the first time, the light on 110v turned on as it automatically detected it.)Cons:- There s really only one con I ve found so far, which is that the concentrator nozzle fits very tight and therefore is really hard to turn. I dry my hair with the nozzle turned vertically, but style with it turned horizontally. Every time I try to turn it, I have to turn the dryer off and actually exert some force. I m hoping it gets easier with repeated use."

On almost 80% of the dryers I looked at for this price, they said they melted, caught fire or got extremely red-hot. This ceramic one is perfect so far. No it doesn't get SUPER hot but I like that. It dries my hair just fine. My hair is past my back almost to my butt. Its not that thick but super long. It took me about 10 minutes to fully dryer my hair with this after I towel dried. The dryer itself is lightweight, has a good grip on it for easy holding, and the actual dryer doesn't get hot, not even the head part. This is exactly what I was looking for. Its not quite a full sized dryer though, maybe mid sized. Too big to travel with but perfect for everyday use.*I will update my review in a month or two and let you all know how it holds up*"

Other than that, it's a decent option if you want a good value for a reliably performing product. It's not especially notable in any particular way, except for maybe the nice matte white body and the clear nozzle attachment, which makes it blend in nicely to an average residential bathrooms. The (detachable) ""rose gold"" filter cap is really more of a nice copper. The motor sound is not too loud, nor does it give off any annoying or unusual high or low frequencies. If there was one thing I'm least thrilled about is the power cord could use about another foot or so to its length."

Someone else noted in their review that their finger accidentally turned off/ down the dryer speed. If I'm not careful the same thing happens to me. I suspect that we're both left handed. I don't find it to be a problem, possibly because I read about it before purchasing and hold the handle lower than I normally would. Very light weight dryer so that is not awkward"

Full-sized dryers tend to be too big and heavy for me, and this product is the perfect size and weight. I was worried that it might be a compact size like other travel dryers, but It s more of what I d call medium sized.Some more pros:- The folding feature allows it to be neatly stored without taking up too much space.- I LOVE the multiple settings: cool, warm, hot for temperature and off, low, high for power. I use it on a warm on high setting according to the instructions that came in the box, and am able to style my hair perfectly every time.- This dryer is supposed to adjust the voltage automatically so you don t have to. (I ve only used it on 110v so far and as soon as I turned it on the first time, the light on 110v turned on as it automatically detected it.)Cons:- There s really only one con I ve found so far, which is that the concentrator nozzle fits very tight and therefore is really hard to turn. I dry my hair with the nozzle turned vertically, but style with it turned horizontally. Every time I try to turn it, I have to turn the dryer off and actually exert some force. I m hoping it gets easier with repeated use."

It dries my hair just fine. My hair is past my back almost to my butt. Its not that thick but super long. It took me about 10 minutes to fully dryer my hair with this after I towel dried. The dryer itself is lightweight, has a good grip on it for easy holding, and the actual dryer doesn't get hot, not even the head part. This is exactly what I was looking for.

Warm is practically cool, which is what I use to dry my hair 80%. Withthis dryer I don't even bother with warm. It doesn't exist. I use the hit setting and remove the nozzle. When I'm ready to style I then attach the nozzle to increase the temp. While I appreciate the lower heats because my hair is recovering from bleach, this won't b effective when it's back n fighting shape. I'm just having to dry longer, which is redundant. If heat isn't a deal breaker for you, you may like this one. If I had a pixie it would work fine. But my hair is past my bra strap and I have a lot of it, so this isn't effective for me.

Hair dryers that don't convert can be a fire hazard. This Conair Worldwide Travel Hair Dryer was designed for those situations. It can automatically switch from 110 V to 240 V, and a sidepiece illuminates to tell you what kind of current is flowing through it. Even though you won't need a power convertor, you will need an adapter to fit international plugs.This hair dryer is larger than many travel hair dryers, although its handle does fold to make it more compact. It also performs better than many of its smaller cousins. Likewise, as a daily hair dryer, its blower is not as powerful as larger models. I find, though, that as long as I don't want a wind-blown look, the heat is enough to dry my thick hair on a daily basis at home. It comes with a clear plastic concentrator for more controlled styling.Instead of the controls running up and down, as on most hair dryers, the Worldwide models has buttons that operate side to side, horizontally instead of vertically. I've had to get used to that. I like that it has three heat options and two blower speeds as well as a cool shot button.Although most electronics these days will automatically convert power, hair dryers rarely do. That feature makes the Worldwide model unique. When you order this hair dryer, make sure the correct model is selected -- or else you'll end up with a full-size model that won't convert.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann"

It also has cool so you can cool down if it s too hot to be drying your hair. The kitty likes hot although I don't want to get too close, so I ll switch to warm after a little. It shows the temperature on the side. It also has two speeds, high and low, for varying intensity, which the kitten can really appreciate.Being a hairdryer, it s still bulky, but the folding handle helps a lot in being able to store it.

This hairdryer is excellent but in case you are trying to decide between the two models I will somewhat compare them.Let's start with this one. The pro's are:1) It is lightweight at 21.25 ounces without any attachments2) The handle is slim and feels very comfortable in my hand, and actually makes it seem considerably lighter than the fold and go, due to being less bulky3) It is quiet for a hairdryer, and is quieter than the fold and go.4) It get's super hot super fast, for a very quick dry5) There is a distinct difference in temperature settings if you need that (hot, medium, cool).6) The fan settings, even when on low dries quickly (low, high)The negative of this model is the toggle settings. While I didn't accidentally switch them, I feel like it makes me hold it differently.How does this one compare to the fold-n-go?1) Well it is pretty much identical in weight and size (see attached picture).2) It is quieter and feels more comfortable in my hand.3)They both dry quickly and this one has different temperature setting with two fan settings, vs the fold-n-go which only has one temperature setting but three fan settings.4) This one seems to get hotter on the hot setting than the fold-n-go, but the fan is not as strong (hence why it is quieter).5) Obviously the fold-n-go folds up and stored the cord in the handle, which makes the handle bulkier.6 ) This one has toggle switches rather than slide switches. I personally strongly prefer the slide settings on the fold-n-go over the toggle settings on this oneThis is a really nice hair dryer and for me the only negative is the toggle switch, otherwise it offers more settings than the fold-n-go and dries just as quickly, with less noise."

One of the quietest I've ever had.Con #1: When gripping the handle, I wrap my hand around it. I am forever making the toggle buttons switch their settings, often without even noticing. I just suddenly have warm air and not hot, etc. This happens all the time. The toggle switch is way too easy to move and the slightest bump switches it.Con #2: I've decided it's not my imagination. It tangles the ends of my hair. I think it has a cyclonic whipping around motion or something. I have long hair and turn my head upside down to dry. I have broken ends in the sink after brushing out the tangles. I switch to my old dryer and it doesn't happen.Con #3: The cord is VERY STIFF and doesn't want to change from the shape it had while folded up in the box. I can hardly get it to stretch long enough from the outlet to dry my hair. I'll try putting it outside on a hot day in the sun to see if it helps, but I have my doubts. It will probably still be too stiff, even if not as crinkled."

I have found that the handle on this dryer is meant to be held as though you are drying someone else's hair, not your own. I bought this for personal use and it is VERY uncomfortable to hold. When you are drying your own hair, you naturally need to hold the dryer at more of an angle with your hand more to the side of the handle. It is nearly impossible to keep the dryer from slipping into a straight position, which then is pointing away from your hair. The dryer itself has a slick black surface and to make matters worse, the buttons are the ones that flip, not flat ones that slide. I have yet to dry my hair without my hand slipping onto these buttons, constantly turning the dryer off. There is nothing to brace your fingers onto to keep it steady so the whole time you are fighting the drying angle while trying to avoid the buttons. It s a terrible design for personal use and for the price, I would not recommend it at all. I am going to try putting some grip tape on the sides to see if it helps but I seriously doubt I keep it."

A removable, cleanable filter cap. 1875 watts.The controls are like those of my other dryers: a coldshot button, a three level heat selector, and two speed fan selector. A do note that (as another reviewer described this arrangement), the switch selection arrangement is counterintuitive compared to other products and models I'm used to -- The fan ""Off"" position is full up. The heat ""Hot"" selection is full down. It's opposite of what I'm used to but I image I'll adapt.Finally - have you noticed that other dryers are promoting their AC motors. That is because that design lasts longer (or theoretically it should). This one has a DC motor. The upside is that it's lightweight and powerful. The downside is that DC motors are more likely to die a spark-filled early death than their AC counterparts.

First, if you look at my profile and my other reviews, you will see I have never reviewed an item for any incentive before. I'm not one of those Vine reviewers who always says something is great because they got it for free and you get it and it's garbage. Second, you will see I rate items honestly. If it's garbage, I will say so, if it's great I'll say so.Ok, now to the point. I did have to buy this item first. I have shelled out my own money and will not get reimbursed until after I review. I get my money back regardless of my review so I have nothing to lose. That being said, this hair dryer actually lived up to it's reputation. I've had it for a little over a week now and use it every day. I am at an age where hormones are wreaking havoc on my hair and I have to wash it every day. That means drying every day.What I noticed right out of the box is how lightweight this dryer is. It has a silicon type feel so it's not slippery hard plastic. That means it's easy to grip and won't crack. Next, the buttons are sideways so while gripping to dry, you won't accidentally change your settings. The accessories actually snap in and they work! My current dryer has accessories but they often don't fit right and really don't work, especially the diffuser. This diffuser works incredibly well and I don't even have super curly hair! It helped my sad waves and gave my hair body and volume, something I sorely need now that my hair is thinning. :(Regarding the claim of drying faster. I would say yes, a bit faster for sure but the more important thing is healthier. I can use a lower heat and airflow setting with this dryer and yet still finish in slightly faster time than my old Revlon dryer. What is the best is it isn't making my hair fly away! With my current dryer I can have static on a seriously rainy day. That is not cool. With this one, no static. Not on rainy days and not on dry winter days. That's HUGE!Lastly, I believe this dryer has been much healthier for my hair. The ends don't feel as dry, my hair definitely lays smoother, no flyaways, no frying, just silky soft.So, I didn't have to leave a positive review but I am happy to do so. I believe in giving credit where it is due. If something happens to this dryer and it burns out long before it should or whatever, I will update this review. I do follow up my reviews if necessary.If you need a dryer, give this one a whirl. It's a great product at a fantastic price. I would definitely say it performs as good as the ones my hair stylists use."

I'm not versed in the whole science behind it.

The cord is nice and long. The unit itself is heavier than my old dryer, but feels solid, quality. It came with these attachments, but, I haven't tried them to see what fun they do.

Plus, they get really hot, so when they DO fall off and blow across the room, when you pick them up and put them back on they are scalding hot and burn your hand. It sucks. Also, all the setting buttons are switches on the handle. The handle that you hold. So, it is super easy to turn it off by accident while you are holding it. Yeah, that happens a lot. I am super disappointed."

It wasn't very big so while you cannot fold it,I wouldn't mind taking it on trips with me if needed. The output of the air is also very strong when it is set to high..I would say this dries my hair in less time than my fancy Panasonic one..I now preferred this one over the other one because it gets the job done quicker.Definitely would recommend this one and buy another one if I need more than 2 around the house."

Seriously. But, it wasn't for me, and the thought of ruining a woman's birthday with the thought of damaged or burned hair ISNT something ANY guy should take lightly. So, when I compared the cost of this JINRI 1875W Hair dryer to the other name brands ive heard of before, it suddenly wasn't so expensive afterall. (She swore it was over 150 after her first time using it though). To quote ""OMG!!! This thing HAD to cost at least $150, At Least! I mean, this babys working waaaay better than my Chi & I paid close to 150. I Love It! Where did you get this from? Don't tell me, this is one that those hairstylists use for the moviestars and big time Hollywood girls isnt it!"" I watched her dry that semi-coarse, curly, ""not just anybody can touch my hair"" hair, and not one time was this dryer put down, or touched to see how hot it was. Before using her Chi, was the Revlon, that constantly got too hot and damaged her hair. I would literally see strands of hair with quarter to half an inch split ends when she finished straightening with that old blow dryer. So, when the Chi was bought, out went the other as fast as garbage on trash day. (& That's where it went too) I'm glad that I bought the JINRI because its dried her hair at the roots, WITHOUT DAMAGING it, and apparently thats something that was impossible to do with the old really cheap blow dryer. ""My Chi wont even do this good without burning my scalp a little"". I didn't believe her, so she pointed the JINRI at my head (my head's close shaved) and said ""I'll prove it"". It stayed aimed in the exact place on the hottest setting as i clenched in preparation for a scolding. It never got too hot to withstand. IM VERY IMPRESSED!!! She has relaxers every 2 months from the salon, so straight (or at least manageable) roots for the whole 8 weeks is mandatory. This dryer has made her hair so soft, that even I can't stop trying to run my fingers through it. A few days later, I see the Chi become the Revlon. I asked if it was broken or something. Her reply, ""Nope, its just that now when I wash my hair I don't hate drying n straightening it cause my hair doesnt feel ""hard"" or dry since Ive been using that new high class probably cost a quarter grand hairdryer u got me."" She's glad she TRIED it. I'm LUCKY it didn't hurt one strand on her head. Talk about a life/death situation.My ONLY PROBLEM WITH THIS HAIR DRYER,....is that I don't think It'll be able to make my grilled cheese sandwiches like the others did.""My advise...(especially to you guys) MAKE SURE YOUR GIRL, WIFE, MOTHER, SISTER, AUNT, GRANDMOTHER, NEICE, or heck...anyone with hair they're proud of, make sure they have one of these!WE DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS JINRI!"

Not your mother's hair dryer! :: I've been on the hunt for a new higher end professional hair dryer and this one exceeds my expectations.-First of all, it came packaged nicely to protect the box (if you were giving it as a gift, this is greatly helpful). It also has multiple attachments. The standard concentrator is to focus on one area of hair, but it also includes a straightening comb and a diffuser like my hair dresser uses. I will comment that the attachments are a bit tight, and take some pressing force to get them on and a bit of brut strength to pull them off. However, I suspect they will losen in time. My last hair dryer, the attachment failed to fit after time, so I prefer these are bit on the tight side, as they will ""stay put"" for years to come. So, I see this as a bonus, provided they losen in time, as I suspect.-The hair dryer itself is a matte black finish and looks expensive like a high end salon expensive dryer! oh la la!-Next, the mechanics of the dryer are fantastic. It is not loud like my old dryer and it heats up quickly and dries twice as fast. The box even says 50% faster, so I timed it with my old one that I know always takes me 11 minute, this literally was less than half that at 5.25 minutes!-It has 7 settings: 3 heat (low, medium, hight) and 3 velocity (low, medium, high) and a cool button.

It keeps tripping the breaker. This has happened 3 different times, so I'm not using it anymore for fear of it catching fire. I do NOT recommend this dryer. (plus as I mentioned in my original review - the on/off button is at the worst possible spot. I can't tell you how many times I turned this thing off by accident. Annoying.)Original review: Jan 2020.This is a good hair dryer. It dries really fast, works great for straightening your hair, and comes with various attachments. It has a red light that comes on when the dryer is on high, which is a tad unnecessary imo, but it's not a problem. It weighs about the same as most dryers, and is about average on noise. My only 2 complaints are the attachments are hard to get on & off, and the button placement on the handle is really annoying. I probably turned it off 5 times the first time I used it, from my hand hitting the button by accident. Hopefully that is just a matter of getting used to it. Those issues aside, I'd still recommend this one because it does work quite well."

New to the infrared technology as my old (now dead) dryer was 10+ years old. I do have fine hair so it has always dried quickly, but I find it to dry much faster with this hair dryer and it definitely has noticeably less frizz afterwards! The dryer itself is really soft to the touch. I like whatever material they used on the housing. Really nice. It did come with the 3 attachments, but I have straight, fine hair so I have zero use for the diffuser. However, I really love the comb option. It helps to detangle and smooth while I dry my hair. It also acts as concentrator, blowing the air in a concentrated stream, so I don't need to switch attachments. I just wish it had a soft plastic coating because the ends of the comb scratch if it hits your neck or where ever. The way I use the comb is by holding the nozzle of the dryer, flipping my head over, and combing through the back of my hair. This helps to give volume too! Would highly recommend!"

I like that there are multiple settings you can use. It s kind of neat that it lights up, but I think that s something to do with the ion drying it says it has, I am unsure if that affects the drying, if it does, it is a positive effect, because my hair looks amazing! Curly hair takes forever to dry with a diffuser, but this cut down the time of my dry by a substantial amount. The size of this dryer also allows it to be fairly portable, so when I travel I can take it along with me. It s got a nice sleek black matte finish that looks cool.

I gave up. So when offered by JNRI (via Instagram) this dryer free for my honest review I thought, ""why not"". Well folks, I finally have a hair dryer that makes me hair look NICE. As though I just went to the salon. It dries quickly and my hair feels so soft and luxurious, I didn't know a hair dryer could DO that. My sister has a super expensive Conair one and even that makes my hair look like garbage. I tried both with and without the shave heat protective spray and same beautiful results. I'm only putting 4 stars because the buttons are black and are positioned different than I'm used to - they are not obvious as to what they control upon first glance, and there is a light inside is red or red orange when it is running.... Which brings me to this: let me first say idk how to tell if something is using infrared tech, or what that even means for my hair, but I do know infrared is invisible to the human eye, so is the red LED a gimmick? I wouldn't know. But it does leave my hair nicer than anything else I've ever used in my years on Earth and still shocked my hair FEELS so nice. Something is working here. For the price and how well it works, I would highly recommend to anyone especially if they have struggled with hair dryers.P.S. also lightweight, not heavy and tiring. And the texture of the dryer is velvety so it even feels nice to touch and hold."

If you re funny about the power and heat then you will know what I m talking about. We like a strong flow and hot heat. Thinking of purchasing one for myself since my other brand just went out.

If I was to buy a hair blower again, however, I would not get this one. I'm a curly girl who needs a good diffuser. I'd look for a diffuser that had a stronger attaching point to the blower (my old blower's diffuser slid on with about an inch of overlap that never gave me trouble)."

For the first time I now have little broken hairs on top of my head!. Never before has a blow dryer done that to my hair. Another Revlon 1875 volumizing turbo will be here tomorrow, and I can't wait. I would not even blow my hair with the Remington yesterday or today. It's not worth the energy to return. Lesson leanred: Stick with what I love."

I'm sooo thrilled with it! My kinky/curly fine/thin hair has dried much faster than usual (even though it's the same wattage as my previous dryer) and so smooth, soft, shiny and healthy looking (getting that without a flat iron also means that it gets to stay fluffier looking instead of flat and stringy). -- I found it cheaper at Walmart, but it says it's a LIMITED EDITION so if you can't get it there, get it here. But GET IT -- it's great!One thing I have to have on my driers is separate controls for the heat and for the air - this does - and it has the cool shot button as well. The really nice thing if you use the end attachment that condenses the direction of the air flow, is that this dryer has a round end (not oval) so you can turn the attachment when you need to instead of holding your arm/wrist in awkward positions to blow at a certain angle.

Say good-bye to heat damage and say hello to an enhanced healthy shine! This specially designed dryer features a grill that is infused with microscopic conditioners. These micro-conditioners release into the dryer air flow, and are transferred to your hair, helping to prevent damage and increase shine and hair health.IONIC TECHNOLOGY: Negative ions are activated by the heat of the dryer to heal heat damaged hair as you style. The ions reduce drying time and infuse vital moisture into the hair, resulting in reduced frizz and static.CERAMIC TECHNOLOGY: Infrared heat is produced by the ceramic coated grill to help prevent damage to the hair and allows for faster drying time.TOURMALINE TECHNOLOGY: This semiprecious gemstone works in conjunction with the ceramic technology of this dryer, producing far-infrared energy which protects the hair cuticle from over-heating, preventing brittleness and cracking.What else do you need to know -- it honestly does what it says - and I LOVE IT!

It does a nice job with both the concentrator and diffuser on medium heat and my hair turns out great. I just takes a little longer. It is a little heavier than some other models, but it feels sturdy and I am hoping it will hold up. I have purchased 4 blow dryers this year (other brand) so far and all have broken within a couple months. Some reviews have complained that the buttons are too easily hit while using, changing the settings. I have not experienced and would have to be gripping it very hard, then move my hand to make one of these switch.

Blows a lot and is not a noisy hair dryer like others in the market. I am a fan of a Remington Brand it last long and love the heat levels. This specific one it was disappointing. I had the orange color one and it was better and of course $10 more in price. This one I truly dislike it! The blow is warm not hot doesn't matter how you change the settings you will feel warm only. I have lots of hair and is long, course and I apply live in spray before blow drying and the same procedure normally takes 30 minutes max to blow dry my hair, and this hair dryer did longer 50 minutes. It does not sound to me it claims to dry faster when you experience yourself. Here is my perspective: It no hairdryer can claim ""fast dry"" because hair differs from being short, medium, long, thick, thin, course etc... it truly all depend on your hair. don't fall for that. If you don't have too much hair then you can go ahead and purchase cheap hairdryers. I believe this hairdryer of the low cost will only help for short hairs, thin, and hair that is easier to manage. Hairs like mine would only get a quality job with an expensive hair dryer probably over $30's. If you have hair like mine I do recommend getting something over $30's. I am returning the product and definitely going to get something at the store, because ordering online takes time and if doesn't work you easily exchange or return."

My daughter has very long and extremely thick hair. She is 11 years old and cannot handle a hot heat setting. My current dryer only has 1 heat setting and it's hot even for me. I have to hold the dryer far from her head to dry it and it takes about 20 min to get it 75% dry. This Remington dryer has 2 heat settings ( and a cool) and 2 blower speeds. I use the low heat setting and high blower and I am not kidding when I say it takes 5 min to blow her hair completely dry now! I don't style it except for running a brush thru it a little as I dry. She flips her head over and I dry the bottom. Her hair is way less frizzy now too! I am buying me this same dryer. I did not benefit in anyway for writing this review. I just really like this hair dryer that much!

Even threw it on the floor once and it's still going. Also, the hair dryer says 'damage control' in the product description. So, for those of you leaving reviews about it not getting hot enough, that's kind of the idea of damage control. It dries your hair without getting too hot, thus not damaging it. I've had to buy a new hair dryer just about every year because they always seem to have the heating element get to hot and break apart. Then the hair dryers only blow cold. This is my first Remington and I hope it doesn't do the same as the others. My husband has had his for several years, which is why I decided to specifically buy a Remington. He swears by their products."

Some hairdryers don't even have that or have one so small it won't hang on a peg.I found that I was able to blow dry my hair quickly with this dryer and I appreciated the control I had, being able to switch between heat settings and air flow speeds to get the perfect look.UPDATE 9/13/15 I still love this hairdryer as much as I did on day one.

I'm not so good about consistently using them because I'm lazy. Well, I also know how harsh blow-drying can be on hair (particularly colored like mine), so I tend to avoid it. But every so often (more so in the winter), I find I need to dry my hair quickly instead of waiting. My last hair dryer died in a blaze of glory - well, actually it more or less fizzled and refused to turn on. So when this popped up in my Vine selection, I selected it.This Remington hair dryer comes with attachments - one, a diffuser, that looks like an alien product (apparently used for curly hair), and a funnel appendage that reminds me of an airplane wind tunnel. I don't have curly hair so I didn't bother with the diffuser (I really wish it had not been included because all it does it take up valuable drawer space), but I did test out the Wind Tunnel (much as I like pretending it's a wind tunnel for miniature airplanes, I would like to know, what is this thing called really?).I love all the settings! My last hair dryer pretty much had hi-lo, hot-cold and that was it. This has 3 heat settings and 2 speeds along with a cold blast setting, allowing for a more controlled drying experience. I found it really dried my thick, wavy hair well (another reason why I hate drying my hair - it usually takes 30 minutes for it to be all dry) and relatively quickly. The Wind Tunnel also helped to ensure nice, smooth, straight hair - the way I like to style my hair.Overall, I'm impressed and pleased. I wish that the diffuser hadn't been included because I have no need for it and the space it takes up BUT I know that those with curly hair may appreciate it.UPDATE 09/18/16: While I still like this product, I have since received a Bio Ionic from Vine, which I like more. The Remington's Cool Burst is far too easily activated when I am drying my hair, a problem I don't have with the Bio Ionic. Therefore, I am taking away 1-star to show this.Brought to you by:*C.S.

My hair is long and dries quickly without frizz. This dryer leaves my hair nice, soft, and fluffy, which is a very good thing when you have fine, limp hair. I want to try the curl attachment and do a scrunching style on my hair, but I haven t played with that yet.I didn t know Remington made hair dryers. Overall, I m very satisfied.

They're a nice perk for the price.I have really thick hair shoulder length hair and this dries my hair in about 5-7 minutes even in a warm, humid bathroom.

(I know I know it s the person not the tool.) When she dries it, she barely has to touch it up with a flat iron. When I dry it I have to do a little more work to straighten out the wavy stragglers.This review compares the Revlon 1875W Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic Dryer, Remington T|Studio Silk AC Professional Hair Dryer, and this one (Remington Damage Control (DC) Ceramic Hair Dryer).All of them have: * Same wattage * Three heat settings * Two speed settings * Cool shot feature * Diffuser and concentrator attachments * Ionic technology * Ceramic technology * Hanging loopThe Revlon does not come with a removable filter, the two Remingtons do. (The TStudio doesn t say it on the box or description. Company website confirms it.) Revlon and Remington Damage Control have tourmaline technology, the TStudio does not.The Revlon s concentrator attachment stays on. The Remington s fall off often. If I put the dryer down to adjust my hair, it comes off some of the time. It's hot to put it back on.All three take about the same time to dry my hair. I may have gotten slightly better results (less wavy) with the Remingtons than with the Revlon. I say may because the difference wasn t large enough to be clear. Some days I do a better job than others. Human error, you know.The Damage Control felt like it took less effort and the reason is most likely because it s the lightest of the three. The shell of the DC and Revlon are plastic while the T|Studio uses better quality materials. But it could be the better quality materials that make it heavier.I can only assume the DC is cheaper than the T|Studio because of its plastic shell even though it has tourmaline technology, which the T|Studio does not.I ve yet to try the diffusers. Whenever I wear my hair curly, I let it dry naturally. That s the whole point of going curly not having to do any hair drying. As for noise I can t answer which one is quietest because I m deaf. It s not a good idea to wear hearing aids while drying wet hair. :)The winner? The Remington DC because it takes the least amount of effort to use and produces the same results as the others. The T|Studio is just too heavy and the Revlon doesn t perform as well as the DC.Update November 16, 2015: I downgraded the dryer from 5 stars to 3 stars because the heating element is giving out. It has been getting as hot in the last couple of weeks. When I switched back to an older dryer, I could see a big difference. Lasted only three months."

Its not terribly loud, and it dried my hair pretty quickly. I have thick, short hair and it dried it in about 5 min, give or take a minute or 2, on the highest fan and heat setting."

I haven t used the diffuser so I can t comment on it. The options of heat and air flow is what I expected. Does it dry hair faster than my previous hairdryer? I use a heat protectant spray which always helps decrease the time to dry.Cons: it s heavier than I expected. I think that has more to do with my lack of normal muscle strength, lol. The grip: yes, because the buttons are the primary real estate of the grip, you ll have incidents of clicking one of the buttons higher-lower or off. I wouldn t exactly call this a con since you ll get used how to hold it without this happening. If you have a travel hairdryer, hold on to it as this one will take up double the space in your luggage.Overall: thumbs up."

I also noticed that the button for the cold air is really easy to press while using the hair dryer, which definitely adds to the fact that I never think the dryer is hot enough. I had to keep pressing the cold air button a few times to make sure I was only getting hot air. And even when I was only getting hot air from the dyer, it didn't seem to be enough. Maybe my last dryer was more powerful so I feel the difference in the heat.

That means that if you shift your finger position at all on the handle, you often accidentally squeeze a button and change the air speed or temperature without wanting to do so.

I am very particular with the products I use on my hair. I use expensive salon brand shampoos and hair care products. I have been using Remington hair dryers for years and I sing their praises! The last one I owned broke after 2 years and so I was recently in the market for a hew hair dryer. I figured I should try a different brand just in case Im missing something out there. I found a high end brand and a cheap affordable one. But they all have one thing in common among reviewers- They either spark or catch fire! Why would I go through that stress and trauma when here I have a brand I know I can trust. So I found this new Remington D3109A. Soon as I got them in the mail I immediately washed my hair and tried this baby right away! I am so happy that it is so lightweight and the buttons are strategically placed where you don't accidentally change settings while you're drying your hair. The temp was just right to dry my hair without frying it and the air pressure compensates for it. My hair felt so soft and glossy when I was done. Thank you for Remington. Never failed to deliver!"

I don't see anything magical about the Ceramic feature. Certainly seems to make no difference to my hair. I'm happy enough with it. I docked one star because the 'cool' air is located in a place that I find myself accidentally turning it on while using the dryer. If you hand slips just a little big--and you don't really clench a hair dryer--the dryer rides up and you are blasting cool air at your wet head. Not a big deal but they should move that switch.

It's a Remington. I've never bad a bad experience with this brand.3. I liked that it has 3 heat settings and multiple speed settings as well. Sometimes I want my dryer to blow on high, but with medium heat. I can make that decision with this dryer. Many only have the option to adjust the speed.3.

The power is more than enough and the 3 heat levels are clearly distinguishable. Pretty pleased with the first weeks news. I will update should the unit differ in performance later down the line as other re Jews indicate it's susceptible to breaking down a bit too early in its lifespan.One real negative to me is that the power chord is not long enough at all. Either you have to be sitting or only use in a bathroom plug which is usually set at waist level as a minimum. Any normal outlet (nearer floor level) means that you can't use it while standing up.Should extend the chord!

I don't hate it. It's not the best either. It doesn't get very hot even on the highest setting, and the fan is really strong. So basically my hair ends up tangly from getting blown all over and I don't use diffusers. I could turn the fan down, but then because it doesn't get super hot it takes forever to dry it. So yeah it's worth about $10. I""m sure in a few months, after I get a little use out of it, I'll get another one. It will be fine for now. But I also wouldn't recommend it."

Success! - or so I thought.I decided to try out the attachment that came in the box, hoping it'd help dry my hair quicker. Mid blow-dry, I knocked off the attachment with my hair brush and it flew off. The tiniest hit detached it! It's made of a flimsy, plastic material that doesn't lock on to the hair dryer well. It didn't bother me initially, but after a week or two I started getting annoyed. The attachment would fall off every few minutes and that prolonged my drying time.

But I would prefer to keep it in the nice aesthetic product box and store it in my bedroom walk-in closet on a shelf [because I only use in occasionally perhaps unlike most other users]. However, the box is not so tight that you cannot store the unit within it as I am doing. But I would prefer it had a contoured saddle fit.

It has three heat and two speed settings, and a cool shot button to help set your style. It's 1875 watts- so it's nice and strong though not as powerful my professional hair dryer that does dry my hair faster. But my hair has been getting split ends and damaged, so I love that this dryer is designed to protect against heat damage. Only time will tell if that feature works, but I sure need it. This also has the usual attachments that I never use but they look the same as what typically comes with a blow dryer. My biggest problem with blow dryers is the motor dies from not regularly cleaning the lint filter (which draws in dust and causes the motor to overheat). So one great feature is this Remington has a removable filter for easy cleaning, and that will definitely prolong the life of the hair dryer if the filter is cleaned out regularly.My hair comes out smooth and nice with the Remington. My favorite part about the design is it's comfortable to hold, the controls are placed well for comfortable use and most of all it's super lightweight. Also, this dryer is not as loud as most others. It looks great in purple too. I do wish the cord was a little longer. It's long enough for plugging into a high outlet in a bathroom, but if I need to use a lower outlet in another room then the cord is too short for me to stand and dry my hair (though adequate if I sit down). I'm used to a longer cord, so others may not mind the cord length, but I'm taking one star off as I think the cord should be at least a foot longer. Overall, however, I definitely recommend this hair dryer as it has great features, works very well and is such a great value!"

I am comparing this hair dryer to the Remington AC9096 I purchased this past Christmas.At 1875W for both models, they both heat up quickly and put out a LOT of heat. The motors are both reasonably quiet with the D3190A having a slightly higher pitched sound to it. Not louder per se, but just a little more trebly.Functions wise, both have 3 fan and 3 heat setting and a separate ""cold shot"" button. The 9096 has a more positive click to the cold shot button but both work well. Both come with the same accessories, a diffusor and a flat nozzle. Both have ceramic and ionic technology though only the 9096 has the ionic ""on"" led light. I'm not sure if you're getting more ions with the 9096 or if that light just for show.Other differences are the intake and output nozzle of the 9096 are smaller so the heat is more directed while the direction of the buttons are reversed (up vs. down being on/off, hotter/cooler. Not really a big deal I suppose.)Lastly, the 9096 is heavier and more back heavy while this 3190 is more balanced meaning it doesn't want to tilt up in your hand. All in all this is a very nice hair dryer for the price while the 9096 beats it in fit and finish ever so slightly - but I suppose that should be expected for the roughly $10 price premium.In summary, it all depends on whether any of these differences are meaningful and whether the small price increase is justified. Either way, both should be solid choices."

It does a good job of drying my hair without getting overly hot. The one issue with this blow dryer is that it doesn't get as hot as most. This can be a good or bad thing depending on your hair and what you want. Drying my hair at a lower heat setting seems to make my hair look nicer. It takes a bit longer to dry my hair with this blow dryer than my other dryers though.I like that this blow dryer is light and easy to hold. The purple color is fun and reminds me of the '80s. I'm not that impressed with the build quality though. It feels flimsier than my other hair dryers.This is the first hair dryer I have owned that came with a diffuser. I like to dry my hair straight, so I am using the diffuser after bathing my dog. It seems a lot less scary to my dog to the air diffused a bit instead of a straight shot of air blown in one spot.Overall, I recommend this hair dryer.

It has three heat settings and two blower speeds. I generally use the medium heat and the high blower, but I like to have the option to do a quicker dry with high heat when needed. It also includes the cool shot button which allows you to quickly cool the dryer down in the midst of drying and styling.It has an easily removable filter, which is a huge plus. I once ruined a dryer because I didn't realize I needed to clean the filter. Now I periodically take the filter off and blow the ""wrong way"" through it to clear dust that accumulates through time. I do this about one a week or so and it helps keep the dryer running well and from burning out. I have placed a towel hook next to my bathroom sink and I hang the dryer on it. It keeps it off the counter, saving room and keeping it within easy reach.The dryer comes with both a concentrator for when you are styling your hair or trying to focus the drying effort as well as a diffuser. The latter is important for me as my hair has a lot of wave and curl and blow drying it without the diffuser turns it all to frizz instead of curls.I'm very pleased with this dryer and recommend it as a good and fairly inexpensive choice."

Only slight downside, which I don't mind at all, is that on the high air flow setting, it's a little loud - nothing crazy, just a tiny bit louder than most. Still, I love it!"

Quick Drying, No Fly-Away Hair. :: I have been using an older model Remington hair dryer, and, while that model has held up well with daily use for over 3 years, this newer model is lighter weight and slightly smaller yet produces the same results as the old model.This Remington says that it has micro conditioners to prevent heat damage and increase hair shine. It also says that its ceramic technology prevents hair damage and dries hair faster.Since using the Remington hair dryers (daily) my hair (untreated and treated) do not show hair damage at all - no split ends, no dry/brittle, no fly-away. Whether this is attributable to the dryer or my hair product (changed when I started treating my hair), I cannot say. I use shampoo & conditioners about every other day and dry my hair every day.Dry time is fast. The new model doesn't seem to have a faster dry, but the dry time is pretty quick nonetheless. I do not use either attachment. This dryer comes with a diffuser (Remington caught flak with the last model not including a diffuser) and a directional blower. Both are standard plastic.Overall, this Remington dryer works well, dry well, and should last a number of years if it follows in previous models' footsteps. Very happy with the feel and results."

For the price point that i paid and its performance, i have to say that i'm very satisfied. Using it with the diffuser has managed to really help dry and define my curls. I've had no issues with any of the attachable parts. And i like the settings. There's a low, medium, and high, and even the highest setting doesn't burn unless you have the nozzle near the edge of your face, Because i have a lot of long curly hair, it takes me about 20 mins to fully diffuse my curls, but i'd much prefer to do that than let it air dry. Can't imagine being without this useful tool now."

We have a big family and own several Remington hairdryers. This one is in the kids bathroom. With its smaller grip it's a good size for older kids and teens to use. It dries hair fairly quickly, on par with most other dryers we've owned. We keep it on a command adhesive hook above the outlet to the side of the sinks. The cord has a good sized built in loop for hanging.I was really happy to find that it comes with both a wide, flat nozzle for straightening as well as a diffuser for curly styles. My fancy high end dryer didn't come with a diffuser and it took forever to find one that fit. I also like that it has a cool button, no need to slide a button up and down to set a style with cool air.My one complaint is that this dryer is a bit noisier than the other Remington dryers we have. It's not so noisy that it consider it loud for a hairdryer but if you're searching for a quiet model know this one is average to slightly above average as far as noise goes.All in all I'm impressed with this hairdryer. It's a fantastic value at this price point. All our other Remington's have lasted years."

That is why this is such an important feature to me,you would think all hair dryers would have it!Now to its features: it has 3 heat settings and 2 power settings (*wish there were 3!) annnd a ""cool shot"" which Iove, Love, LOVE! I have very thin, fine hair and when I set my hair with heat rollers I use the ""cool shot"" feature to speed up the ""set"" and my curls stay in longer as the hair is more cooled down before I take the rollers out so the curls don't fall out as quickly as they used to, my set lasts longer.I use the concentrator but have no need for the diffuser but if you are naturally curly it is a nice attachment to have.It has the heat protection ""ionic technology"" that helps keep your hair frizz and fly away free, dries hair fast (I have long hair) and doesn't tangle it up when just doing a blow dry and not setting my curls.It has a 2 year warranty and is at a GREAT price for what you get. I would recommend this dryer."

Mine died after using less than 2x/week for 5 months :: I wanted to write a glowing review; while this dryer worked, I really loved it. I loved how soft and silky my hair felt after using it, and once I realized that by pre-drying my hair with my regular blow dryer about halfway THEN switching to the brush dryer, my drying time was considerably shortened and I *thought* I'd extend the life of the brush dryer by not using it for 15 minutes at a time to dry my just past shoulder length hair.Cut to yesterday morning: I went to use the dryer for the first time in a week (during the summer, unless I have a client meeting, or somewhere special to go, my hair is towel-dried then put in a ponytail), and I heard it crackle a little when I started it. I looked at it, everything seemed ok, so I went about finishing drying and styling my hair. About 2 minutes of use on the high setting later, I heard several crackle, pops and fizzing sounds, then smoke started pouring out of the top. I immediately turned it off, unplugged it and put it in our tub in case it started burning. The smoke died out quickly, but there is no way in heck I'm plugging it in to see if it works.I've looked all over this site, and did a Google search; good luck finding a website to claim your warranty. I foolishly just tossed the box it came in about 3 weeks ago (argh!!!!), so I'm SOL. If anyone has the warranty still and could share the website/phone number to contact this company, I'd really appreciate it.I can't recommend purchasing this dryer. I didn't expect it to last forever, but certainly more than 5 months with 2x/less use per week!! I'd give this zero stars if I could. BUY ANOTHER COMPANY'S PRODUCT."

I have never had any hair dryer do this. My hair has knots in it after I dry my hair. I am purchasing a new dryer to replace this one.This hair dryer held some surprises for me. I was surprised at how heavy it is. It probably weighs twice what my most recent (broken) dryer does. The second surprise is that it is infrared, which the description does not note. I was surprised to turn the dryer on and have a bright red light shooting in my face. Infrared lights are damaging to the eyes so I feel the need to use caution with this dryer. While I was drying my hair my face was lit up bright red the entire time. The dryer is a great deal and included several attachments. One reviewer mentioned an included hanging bag but mine did not have this. I like the long, professional type cord. Although the dryer works well, I would not buy it again nor recommend it based upon the weight and infrared light."

The handle is a nice finish which makes it easy to grip and not hurt your hand, but still prevents it from slipping out of your fingers. Its a good size, not too small and not too large.I only have 2 downsides, but they aren't enough to take away a star. 1) the red light is BRIGHT. 2) the attachments don't all attach the same way. The diffuser you put in, and twist while the other 2 you have to completely pop into place. Popping them into place is a pain but it works.

The strongest airflow was on cold and with hot it was very mild. Now it barely puts out any air except on cold and then it s very light airflow. I m super disappointed as I love the dryer and the concept of it but it is really useless. I don t have hours to spend under a cold air dryer.

Figured I'd look it up and was surprised at how inexpensive it was so bought it. I've always had a military haircut so know nothing about hair dryers - assumed they all blow warm air and are all the same. Apparently not and being much more powerful AND smaller to pack AND lighter to hold is a big plus for a hair dryer. I like the 'old school' flip switches and color coding. Very intuitive to use. Not that any could be very hard to figure out how to operate, but you just glance at this and in 1 sec are an 'expert' on how it works. Been in use daily now for several months and still works great.

The switches seem to be of poor quality. I actually fixed mine, though it took me probably a couple of hours to take it apart, unsolder the switch, take the switch apart, melt the ABS plastic with my solder reflow hot air gun (the hole had elongated), redrill the hole for the springed metal pin which activates the contact strip, and re-assemble everything. That took way too long, but I did not spend any of my taxable earned income. I learned a couple things, but I didn't cross anything off my honey-do list that Saturday. If it happens again in fourteen months, I'll probably replace it with a non-matching but electrically overrated similar switch. Sorry, I should have taken pictures! I really wouldn't expect normal people to be willing or able to fix their hair dryer, so it may be best to avoid this model. Ergonomically, I like it a lot, but hairdryers in general may have contributed to my not being able to hear frequencies above 9.7 KHz at age 55, although that frequency seems quite high enough to me..."

It also feels like it can last a lifetime. :)Noise -It's so much quieter than other high power hair dryers. You don't have to shout to be heard. :)Button Layout -All the buttons are in the right place. Easy to understand and easy to use.I don't like the others that you can push a button to get temporary cool air. It's confusing and requires extra effort / finger to use.Usage -When we got the new one, we tried it out and we like it very much!! It's much better than all those high power hair dryers.Yes, the max power output (wattage) is less than other 1850.

It takes maybe 20 now and I can actually dry it all over, even with my head upside down! Hasn't sucked my hair into it even once.

I'll take credit for that failure.The second one I bought in July of 2012 and it just died (October 2013), NOT because of anything I did. For a while now the handle has been getting hot, and yesterday some smoke came out of the handle and now the heat hi/lo switch is stuck in the ""hi"" position. It's clear the switch has failed, at least partially, and I don't feel the unit is safe to use.So I'm ordering another one and we'll see how it goes. If it only lasts a year I'll be looking for a different model next time.UPDATE 3/2015: The new one failed too at the ripe old age of a year and a half. Same problem, a switch quit working.

As with other customers, I discovered it while staying at hotels. I figured they must have researched it enough to know it would last. Not sure how it is working out for the hotels, be I figure mine last about 3 years. I purchased my first one about 6 years ago, it broke and was replaced by the manufacturer (under the 5 year warranty). Unfortunately, the replacement didn't last more than 3 years, so here I am purchasing a replacement. Again, as other customers indicated, the power switch failed in both units. In the first one, the dryer just wouldn't power on. The second one was a little more dramatic with heat and smoke. My final point is a ""pet peeve"" that I have with blow dryers in general (and this one is no exception). In my opinion, all blow dryers should have a 3 position heat switch (cool, warm, hot) and 3 position speed switch (low, medium and high) in addition to the power switch. I would even accept an ""off, low, high"" speed switch (which remove the need for a power switch)."

Both dryers now have stuck switches, and you can't change the temp settings. They have a very short life. Now, I have to go find two more dryers. I think I will stick to a name brand, and just pay a little more. I would not recommend this item if you expect it to lasts reasonable period of time."

What I like best about this dryer is that it puts out a high volume of air, not just super hot air. This unit uses the 'old school' style of blower like the dryers of the 1970s and 80s. I'd forgotten how much more air this kind of dryer puts out and it seems that the higher velocity of air dries my hair much faster than the more modern style of high heat / low velocity dryers commonly found now. It's also nice to have the option of controlling both the blower speed and heat level. The dryer is very light weight and easy to handle and control. My chief complaint is that the unit I received seems to have considerably more vibration transferred to the hand than the unit I used at the hotel. Overall, I am pleased with the product.UPDATE September 2011: About six months ago, after about a year and a half of use, the dryer still works but started making a loud squeaking / grinding sound when the motor runs at high speed. The noise is in conjunction with the excessive vibration I reported 2 years ago when it was new. While the dryer still technically works, it's unpleasant to use as the noise is annoying and quite loud. Because of questions regarding the durability of the product, I am lowering the rating."

I was concerned since several reviews stated that they had problems with the unit failing after using it only for a short time. So far I am very pleased with my purchase and am considering buying two more to keep as reserves. It is almost impossible to buy 1600 W dryers now and even harder to find dryers than have the side mounted motors and fans which I like. The new 1875 W dryers can cause circuit breakers to trip and I don't feel we need that much heat on our hair. We must all remember that in this economy everyone is trying to cut costs, and that pertains to hairdryers as well as everything else. Anything we can do to reduce the shock to a new appliance can possibly lengthen the life of the product. Nothing lasts as long as they used to as we have found with clothes washers and dryers, refrigerators, dish washers, AC units etc. However, so far, I am extremely pleased with this hairdryer.

They have a five year warranty on these dryers and they sent the first replacement quickly. They will send a second replacement at no cost to me (the first return cost $10.00 to send the dryer back). Hopefully the second replacement will last a couple of years. I am suspicious though because the same problem developed in the second dryer, only quicker. My concern is that if one would leave the dryer turned off, but plugged in to the wall outlet, would it overheat on its own and start a fire? Oh, and FYI I don't have thick waist length hair.

My dryer lasted almost 7 years before the switch broke. Otherwise, it was still in really good shape and worked well. 7 years might seem like a long time, but considering my parents still have a hairdryer from over 30 years ago, I don't consider 7 very long.

The best hair dryer EVER :: I encountered this hair dryer at a luxury hotel. I (AND a friend who was staying at the same hotel) fell so in love with it, we both immediately bought one. Here's why:1) POWERFUL. Dries your hair quickly when on top speeds.2) Great speed choices: you can easily switch between high and low for both air and heat.3) Nice size---not too heavy, nor too big and cumbersome to pack along.4) Dries my hair more smoothly and nice than ANY other hair dryer. Seriously, I can TELL the difference between using this hair dryer and the one in my second bathroom---or any other one, for that matter.5) Has yet to overheat (I hate waiting for cooldown for the dryer to restart!) nor trip the electrical breaker.6) Reasonably quiet (quieter than my old one, anyway). You still won't be able to hear people talking to you unless they shout.7) THE PRICE! All this for under $20!Why would you want to spend more, with all the great reviews on this hair dryer? I've had mine for 4 months now so I can't tell if it will last long-term, but I expect it will last a few years, like my last one (with a little bit of care, such as cleaning the dust off the intake occasionally)---and even if it doesn't, who cares? It is soooo worth the $20!FIVE-MONTH FOLLOWUP: Still love this product---I have noticed when I use other blow dryers my hair doesn't look as good. No problems at all--highly recommended, a real deal for the price.ONE YEAR FOLLOW-UP: I bought a second one of these for my second home. As others have pointed out, it has a short life. The one I bought on Nov 27, 2010 died on Sept 10, 2011---less than a year of service. It just quit mid-dry, one day.

It takes me only about 10-15 mins to completely dry my hair - but I have short and very thin, but with my older Conair dryer it did take longer and still had wet patches of hair. With Sabuy helps me define, give volume, diffuses in shorter amount of time and fully dries my curls. So glad I went with this one, it definitely saved me money too compared to other $100+ dryers."

Today, I didn't have to flat iron my hair. It blew out perfectly straight without any frizz (used the attachment for a more concentrated blow out).

Truly saves half the time!I never treated myself to a quality dryer before, so I really appreciate the nozzle-heads included: one for styling, one for smoothing, and the diffuser. The diffuser is what I start with at the roots of my damp head of hair.I have thick long asian hair & put their advertisement to the test. And I actually could dry majority of my hair (combing in sections, using the smoothing nozzle) in 6-7mins!In addition to the time saved, I'm impressed that the power of this dryer (2200 W, 110v, 60Hz) is quieter than most. The motor isn't blaring in my ear while drying. I also LOVE the air temperature control! (so that my face isn't sweaty after I'm done blow-drying).Bottom-line: worth it!"

What used to take me 10 minutes to dry my hair has been decreased to around 5 minutes. My hair even seems to be shinier and less frizzy. I have curly hair so I like the large diffuser adapter. It lets just enough air out to dry my hair without making it frizzy. It also has 2 other attachments but I don't use them. My husband used to complain about how loud my old hairdryer was. This morning he didn't complain at all or wake up from the noise. I also like that there is a cooling button so when the hairdryer gets too hot, I can push the button and then it's instantly cool. I was surprised how light it is. Whenever I opened up the box the hairdryer was rather large but when I picked it up, it was light. The cord is pretty long so you don't have to be right up against the wall trying to dry your hair. You have room to move away from the wall. I recommend purchasing this hairdryer!!!"

Even though some hair dryers say they have the same wattage, it doesn't mean they have the same blowing power.

Not to mention it's so much quieter! - Its 2200w motor is so powerful that I don't want to use any home used hair dryers. I threw away my Revlon 1875w dryer away immediately, and I was not happy with my Revlon one-step airbrush, as it doesn't give as much shine as this blow dryer can to my hair. - Better than John 2200w hair dryer (~$60). Their features are almost the same - same motor wattage, same blowing power, but the Sabuy one came with more concentrator/ diffuser. Also, the John one is super loud, and the vibration of the motor makes my arm sore when blow drying my hair.- As good as my Solano Supersolano 3600 Ion (~$229) and the Sabuy one might be slightly quieter.

The old dryer started giving out and the inside would light up with a bright, fiery ring. So, it was time for a new one. I was very pleased with this blow dryer since I've had it, but now tonight it randomly stopped working! The dryer that I've had for SIX MONTHS did the same exact thing as the blow dryer I had for 5+ years!!! I turned it on and it made a wheezing sound like it wasn't fully powered. It instantly smelled smoky. I looked inside the dryer and sure enough it was lit up with the same fiery ring that my old one did. Please note, this is NOT normal and has not happened once since I've had this dryer. The fiery ring gets so hot it can melt plastic, which surely means it can melt your hair. I tried to reset and test both the blow dryer and the outlet, tried different outlets and the blow dryer continued to do the same thing one or two more times and then eventually just died. It will now not turn on at all. So now I am stuck here at nearly 1 a.m., exhausted with wet hair thanks to this POS hair dryer. Maybe I got a lemon, but I will not be buying another Conair hairdryer. So frustrated and disappointed. Seeing that I've had it less than a year, I feel like there should be some kind of warranty, but I don't see any info on the product page. Sigh"

Had a hair dryer at home, but didn't want to lug that one back and forth. Ordered this one after looking at many reviews of hairdryers. None of the hair dryers get unanimous good reviews. This one had mixed reviews, like the others. But, it seemed to float to the top.The hair dryer does work well. No complaints. It is relatively quiet -- not super loud like those small mini-blow-dryers. The larger full-size dryers should always be expected to be quieter than the small ones. That's why I wanted a full-size dryer. The blower power seems perfectly adequate, and dries my hair quickly. Not too hot, but hot enough for the job. Didn't want to spend a lot of $.

I only mention it in the spirit of full disclosure.I do have an issue with the plug not fitting tight in the wall socket. If I move around too much it pulls out of the socket. I tried giving the prongs a pinch with my fingers to see if I could make it fit better but they are pretty stiff so no luck there.

Granted, I have short hair but it's still thick. The dryer doesn't weigh so much that my hand and arm become fatigued when I use it. There are two speeds and three heat settings with a separate button for the cool shot of air that is used to set curls in place. I don't have curls so that function isn't something I've tested out. The chord is not retractable, but that's not such a bad thing because that feature is what caused the cord to flex so much it finally shorted out on my previous hair dryer. The back of the dryer has a filter which you can remove for cleaning as well as a plastic ring made into the handle of the dryer so you can hang it up on a hook if you want to. The concentrator head will be useful for drying one specific segment of hair at a time.Now, this hair dryer is 1875 watts. That is very powerful so you need to be aware that any other appliance in use on the same circuit when you turn this hair dryer on can cause a 15 amp circuit (or fuse) to trip. Make sure you are using only this appliance on a circuit before you turn it on. Also, the manufacturer strongly recommends you perform an ALCI safety test - Appliance Leakage Circuit Interrupter - each time you get ready to use the hair dryer if you are operating it anywhere near water. Details for how to conduct this test are included in the information leaflet."

It doesn't come with a diffuser, but I don't use one. It does however come with the vent attachment so you can direct the air flow. My son uses the dryer as well and likes it.

My first impression when I took it out of the box was that it is smaller than what I'm used to and fairly light weight. These would be beneficial features if the product actually performed the way I expected it to. It almost seems more like a travel dryer than a full size one for daily use. I also found the cord a little too short when reaching across my body. On the hot setting and low speed, the air does not really blow hot, and it is not strong enough. On hot and high, it smells like the motor is burning. About halfway through the drying process, I switched back to my old dryer (which has not been working properly) to finish drying my hair. I will be returning this model and looking for another. Summary:Pros: Small, light weight, easy to handleCons: Does not blow hot enough or strong enough on low setting, cord too short"

I had an old Conair for about 25 years and it was great. It had a really high cycle and it got really hot! It finally died a couple of weeks ago so it was time for something new. I don't spend a great deal of time drying my hair so I decided to go the cheaper route. One thing I really DON'T like about this dryer is the handle. It is very uncomfortable to hold!! It also doesn't get very hot. I am hoping it lasts but for $17.99 I don't expect it to last too long!

Second, the plug fits so loosely in the wall socket that hardly any movement unplugs this thing.

I contacted several companies about various models, and Conair was the only company to affirm that none of the parts in this hairdryer (as of April 2018) contain teflon.The hairdryer itself is so-so. It's not very powerful. I mainly use it to help my bird dry off after her baths and she loooves it, but I do wish it would dry a little faster. I have short but thick hair and it's almost just as quick to let it air dry than to use this.So: safe bet to use around/on birds, but if you're not worried about Teflon, maybe look for something with a little more power!"

I bought my 2nd one for my travel bag. My original one finally was getting very red coils, smelled at times, then, it stopped working. It was no longer as powerful either, but, I have long hair, it lasted for years, so is to be expected. The 3rd one, I recently ordered from Amazon. It is quite powerful, I don't remember my other 2 'sucking' my hair into the filter end as much, but, my hair has gotten longer too. My daughter has one, doesn't like it because of that either (her hair is longer, both have hair mid back). I like it well enough, price was awesome, so am just being aware of the power & the intake filter power, so my hair doesn't get caught in it. I plan of getting about 5"" cut off soon, so the should help too. It usually happens when I bend over & dry my hair. So, other than that, I do recommend this. If you have short hair, this would dry your hair in no time. I normally use the lowest heat setting, (better on hair) & bought a separate hair diffuser that I can use on it (Sally's Beauty Supply) to 'set' my hair spray. That's a hint to try too for hair spray lovers, it helps set & hold the hair when using a low setting, heat setting on the spray. Hope this helps!"

It is definitely lighter weight and smaller than ""Old Red,"" but once again, it definitely feels like it's lesser quality.That being said, my expectations for it were really low, yet I was surprised by how quickly it dried my hair. I have really thick hair that usually takes a long time to dry, but I was able to finish it in about 5 mins with the new dryer on Hot & High speed. I don't spend much time styling my hair, so I'm sure results for others will vary.There was an unpleasant smell of plastic when I first turned it on, but it quickly went away. I also felt like, as others have said, the ""hot"" setting wasn't really that hot, but my hair was drying so it didn't matter. It did get hotter the longer it was on though.I'm still a bit skeptical as to how long it will last, but this little dryer is so far winning me over.Pros: Fast drying, light weight, smaller than many full-size dryersCons: feels cheaply made, would be nice to have more settings, but seems fairly standard for price range."

This is advertised as a ""pro styler"" but my stylist assures me it's not. The truly professional blow dryer she uses is 2500 watts, can't be purchased by non-professionals and can get mega-hot! What I'm really happy about with this dryer is it's the first Conair I've owned that has a hot setting that is actually warm instead of hot enough to steam vegetables. Far less chance of damaging the hair. I've had 80% fewer split-ends at trim time and this blow dryer is one reason. It's lightweight, dries quickly and is easy to handle. I use the concentrator that comes with it. That was my stylist's advice. The ionic conditioning feature combined with pointing the dryer, with the concentrator, in the direction of hair growth smooths the cuticle. I Conair and I'll NEVER use any other brand!"

It is extremely light (less than a pound) and actually much lighter than my old bio ionic powerlight. The nozzle is very easy to take on and off and it's great because the dryer itself does not overheat. My hair normally takes 15-25 minutes with a typical dryer. I have very long, thick, curly and easily frizzy hair. The 10x takes me between 9-12 minutes but the result is much better with the 10x than my old powerlight. This dryer makes my hair feel exceptionally soft, light, defrizzed, and smooth, without the need for a flat iron--definitely the best blow out I've had in a long time! The cold button is great and I think the variety of settings is more than enough for me. The bio ionic powerlight would take me between 10-14 minutes depending on the humidity outside and how conditioned my hair is, so in terms of time, I found the 10x to definitely be faster overall with a better overall result. My stylist recommended the bio ionic brand in 2012. I bought the bio ionic powerlight 4 years ago and it does a great job at reducing styling time and smoothing out my hair. However, I find the new 10x to be more effective at not drying out my hair as much. The 10x definitely gives more shine and reduces frizz substantially. The dryer still works great but I wanted to try a new dryer. I will keep the powerlight as a travel/back up dryer. By the way, I have burned out three T3 dryers in less than a year so having a ten year motor warranty is a big deal for me.

Super efficient! Worth it! :: I don't usually take the time to write reviews but I have to on this purchase. I have two young daughters and I am blowing out their hair all the time along with mine. It takes a lot of time to do this all. I have three other Bio Ionic blow dryers along with their flat iron and brush. They are the best. We all have curly hair so we need to fix our hair a lot.So, this is by far the strongest and most efficient blow dryer I have ever used. It is also so very light. I was surprised. It is so strong that when I was using it and my husband turned on the microwave my electric shut off on that side of my house and my husband had to go in the garage to flip the circuit breaker. So, I figure it's using a lot of power. I have never had that happen with another blow dryer. So, it;s obviously super strong. It blows out our hair well too. I feel like it takes less time to dry our hair which is why I bought it because I am doing three people's hair right now.I used all my Amazon points to buy it so I only ended up paying $70 when I bought it. So, I would definitely recommend buying this blow dryer. Yeah, it's very expensive but for me it's worth the time and energy that we take to get ready because I don't have any extra time in my schedule raising two young girls and most other people I know don't have extra time either to blow out their hair and get ready to go out.

So much less damaging, too. It is a hair dryer, so it is never going to be silent, but I find it less screechy/high pitched than other dryers.

Because I believe that value is just as important as results. I would have given this blow dryer a higher rating but the price was just too much. I compared this with two other dryers, one costing $30, the other $100. At three times the price, this baby just didn't stand out for three times the performance. If your gifting this, the packaging will impress; heavy weight box, expensive paper, and a satiny storage bag. The instructions (English, Spanish, & French) cover just the basics, no mention of how or when to use the included diffuser or how the attachment changes the end drying result. The dryer IS very lightweight. It has a removable filter, a cool shot button and three settings; low, medium, and high. There are no independent settings for air flow and heat -- even my cheapo $30 dryer has that! It's a must for flexibility for different types of hair or styles. Since I have fine hair, I'm limited to the medium setting with this Bio Ionic because the high setting has too much heat. It did seem to dry it a little bit faster, but not dramatically so. The dryer isn't excessively loud or high pitched. The cool shot button had an improved feature. Usually you have to hold the cool shot button down, but with this dryer, you just hit it once and it stays cool til you hit it again. Nice! The Velcro strap to tie up loose power cord is also nice. In summary, this is a nice lightweight dryer that performs well but with so many others on the market, even with ionic features, that I didn't find anything this one did to justify the price. I'd pass on this and spend those extra bucks elsewhere."

It s not easy going through mixed ratings & opinions for different products, but I decided to give this a go when I came across what seemed-to-me a great deal (not on Amazon). I do not typically review products often since it s just time-consuming, but I felt compelled to review this item, to hopefully benefit others. I just used my new dryer and am blown away (pun intended). I am choosey with hair products and believe that better tools do make a difference. I thought I was happy with my current dryer, but knew it was a matter of time before I would need a new one. I also did not love the weight of it, having a bulging disc in my neck, along with chronic neck/shoulder pain. I love a decent self-blowout, but dread having to go about it myself. I have never had an easier time blowing out my hair. It was definitely faster, probably twice as fast, and a much more pleasant experience. This dryer is light and feels very professional. It is definitely not as loud and its sound does remind me of professional dryers when I have my hair cut and styled, though not quiet, a more muted sound somehow. I hope that my opinion/review holds up. I am excited, look forward to styling my hair with this Bio Ionic dryer and REALLY look forward to a new cut, knowing that I will actually have a better chance of being able to replicate the professional blowout style on my own now. Less frizz was also a plus (I do use hair product, but my routine was unchanged from using my former dryer)! In case it helps, I have med-long length, wavy, med texture ,and a lot of hair.I don t think you will be disappointed. Definitely consider this Bio Ionic 10x dryer!"

The easy to maneuver handle minimizes wrist fatigue, while its three-level power switch smoothly slides along the contoured handle for speed selection, softly clicking into place at each stop.The ""Cool"" button necessitates that extra little bit of pressing distance to click into engagement, which avoids inadvertent toggling between hot and cool. Disengagement of the button produces the cool air. The unit promptly transitions between temperatures for precisely controlled, gentle styling.The dryer includes an attractive, large, protective storage bag that is big enough to hold both the unit, and its included speed dry nozzle. It has a twisted rope style of drawstring. The bag is beautifully embroidered with the Bio Ionic 10x logo, as well.I am impressed with the quality of the product. Its easily removable filters makes it simple to clean the air passage in order to maintain motor performance. At a little bit more than eight-foot in length, its thick, flexible cord is well reinforced at both ends, and is equipped with circuit protecting test and reset buttons on its compact block plug. It boasts zero EMF, zero ozone, and zero carbon micro-particle emissions. An incredible 10-year motor life warranty completes this remarkable package.If an amazing dryer with advanced technology that results in an average of seventy-five percent less energy use appeals to you, it is but one reason among the many to go with the Bio Ionic 10x. It's just an outstanding product."

This was the only one I found where the heat and wind speed can be operated independently, like on most full size dryers. In addition, many of the reviewers said the heat was too low for their liking. Ah hah! This just might be the one for me.The low heat truly is low, just enough to get my super thick pixie dry without taking an hour to dry on cold. And the best part: I use the wind to sculpt my unruly wavy hair into a pixie haircut. THIS BLOW DRYER HAS EXTREMELY STRONG WIND SPEED. It shapes and sculpts my hair quickly and perfectly.Finally, since it is so short from front to back, and combined with my lack of arm mobility, I can actually get the back of my hair dry for a change.For all of these reasons, I declare it the best $18.95 I ve ever spent.

Both high and low settings are like a wind tunnel that has my medium length hair flying all over the place. If you are trying to grab a section of hair with your round brush, good luck keeping it in. The force of the air on this little device blows my fine hair right out of the brush. And, there really isn't a lot of heat.

It uses Ionic Technology, so it dries my waist-length, hair quickly without as much damaging heat. My hair has suffered from years of coloring and abuse, so I am thrilled to find a blow dryer that doesn't need to produce scorching heat to dry my hair in less than 10 minutes.To give you some idea of how strong the airflow its, I've included a pic of a macaw feather that the air had split. That's pretty strong.I recently replaced my old full-size dryer when I noticed the plug got extremely hot and burned my fingers. The dryer was a fire hazard, and after ten plus years, it was time. It was also bulky and took up space in the cabinetI replaced it with a compact blow dryer, not for travel, it just takes up less space. It produced a lot of heat but lacked strong airflow. I prefer stronger airflow to heat.About the only time, I would prefer high heat is if my A/C coil freezes up and I need to defrost the evaporator coil quickly so the technician can diagnose and repair my air conditioner. My hair is an entirely different matter because there is a lot of old-growth with dried out ends. I'll keep that other dryer in the air handler closet for air conditioning emergencies.The switches are conveniently located on the front of the handle and I find it easier to use than the side controls on my other hair dryer because I am left-handed. I usually just use the highest setting, but now I don't need to fumble for the controls while I am using it if I want to switch to another setting.I glanced at the enclosed warranty and safety pamphlet and couldn't believe it has a 48-month warranty. I don't think I have ever seen that before on any appliance, large or small. Conair must be pretty confident in the quality of this product because that's amazing.I checked out their website to find out if the ion technology could be turned on and off. This model does not have that option. I copied the following information:NFINITI MINI PRO PLUS 1600 watts Compact and full power Powerful, lightweight AC motor 3 heat / 2 speed settings Ionic technology for smooth and shiny hair True cold shot button to lock style in place Removable filter for easy cleaning to extend motor life Hanging ring Concentrator for pinpoint stylingAbout the only thing that would make it perfect would be a high heat option should I want to use it for any application that requires heat. Things like shrink wrap and defrosting my air conditioner. Overall, I am very impressed with this hairdryer and highly recommend it.** If you found this review to be helpful at all, please take a moment and click the button below to let Amazon know.

The actual exposed cord is 60-1/2"" long (the rubber is 3-1/2"" and the plug is 3"")It has a removable Intake screen (rear of the dryer where the fan is)They say in the AD that it is 40% smaller than it's Full size cousin (and this is correct)..... But it sure is NOT 40% less powerful.I looked through HUNDREDS of ""small"" hair dryers, trying to find one that would be the best (for me) to domestic Travel with. What I wanted was the ""smallest"" dryer that was able to have high velocity blowing on all temperatures High, Medium, Low (Hot, Warm, Cool). The Mini Pro does this..... and few others will.The Conair Mini Pro Plus is NOT a dual voltage dryer.... Below is why a dual voltage dryer is not so good.Here is the deal with these dual voltage Travel dryers (125V - 250V) is they have HOT / High velocity but because they are able to be used in other countries that use 250V..... what they do is make the Warm / Low velocity ONE HALF of the wattage..... So let's use A typical travel dryers highest Wattage = 1600-watts on HOT/ High velocity..... then they cut it in HALF for the Warm / Low velocity..... so the Warm / Low = 800 watts.... IE: Not too warm and not too much velocity..... In other words it will take a long time to dry your hair on the Warm / Low setting..... (and if you are in the 250V country you have only 1 speed/temp = HOT/High).The Andis 1600-Watt MicroTurbo Dual Voltage Hair Dryer.... is almost the perfect travel dryer, the problem with it is what I just wrote above..... And the HOT is really Hot on that micro dryer (not even good for your hair).... The other problem with it is because it has such a short nozzle.... It does not concentrate the blowing air very good.I have attached many pictures that should give you an idea on the size.... So you will have an idea on how it ""sizes"" up to others.Pictured included in this review, are:* INFINITIPRO BY CONAIR 1875 Watt Salon Performance AC Motor Styling Tool/Hair Dryer; Soft Touch Black (Full Size Dryer).* INFINITIPRO BY CONAIR Mini Pro Plus Hair Dryer/Styler with AC Motor, Black (Mini Size Dryer).* Andis 1600-Watt MicroTurbo Dual Voltage Hair Dryer; White (Micro Size Dryer)."

I have always purchased larger sized hair dryers with large fans because I want to get the drying job done quickly without using excessive heat and without waiting for low air flow. However, they do take up a little more space when traveling, especially when making shorter trips and wanting to carry necessities in a carry-on without checking luggage. When the cord of my previous dryer started to become loose at the handle from a few years of use, it was time to start looking again to check out the current batch of available dryers. The task was a bit more difficult because I also require separate speed and heat switches, as well as switches that are designed so that settings are not easily changed inadvertently when in use.After reading many reviews and comparing products, I decided to give this really compact dryer a try without setting my expectations too high. To my surprise, this little dryer produces an amazing amount of air, comparable to and actually exceeding many larger dryers that I've used over the years! It heats the air to either warm or very warm, but not so hot as to be uncomfortable or maybe damage hair. The switches are ideal as they are easy to set and almost impossible to change by accident. The grip is really comfortable, based upon use by both me (over 6' with larger hands) and CINC House (5-5 with smaller hands), and you don't have to worry about flipping a switch when changing your grip which I really appreciate.While it's immediately obvious that most hair dryer reviews are written by women, I felt compelled to write this one up while taking a break from my normal activities of chopping wood with my shirt off, digging huge ditches with my CAT backhoe, tossing hay bails and huge logs for fun, and arm wrestling at the pub for the affections of some other hair drier reviewer. The bottom line: I believe this little hair dryer is my favorite of all time and I highly recommend it!"

Some hair dryers can have a thick diameter on the head (lol) where I have to really stretch the Curly Co diffuser around but this fits perfectly without stretching it. I love that there are three temperatures (cool, warm, hot) and three speeds. There is also a shot of cool air, too. I was looking at other mini hair dryers that didn't have as many temperatures.

Anyway, great for you curlies with the orchid! The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is I wish the cord was another few inches. It's not bad but my old dryer was a little longer.

Also, the diffuser I use is large, but this has plenty of power to blow through it. It is lightweight, which is a plus. The only reason I rated 4 stars instead of 5 is because I feel like the power control switch is too low on the handle to easily switch to off when using the diffuser. I would prefer that it be higher where the heat control switch is. I also think the kind of switch that slides up and down and set into the handle, instead of sticking out from the handle would be easier to control, which would mean you wouldn't accidentally change setting while blowdrying."

It was not a good decision. My hair is short and very fine. Even on the low speed, the dryer was so powerful that it blew my hair right off every brush I tried. After some research, I bought this mini dryer. It is wonderful! I use it on warm heat and low speed. My hair stays on the brush, and the heat is enough to dry it. The dryer is lightweight and not as big as the 1875W one. For me, both characteristics are great. Holding a heavy dryer behind my head is no longer easy.One reviewer wrote that this mini dryer has an extremely strong wind speed. I have never tried the high speed, so I can't confirm, but the low speed is exactly what I need, and I don't consider it extremely strong.

Then scrunch out the crunch and I'm good to go. I do wish that the cord was just a bit longer. I haven't traveled with it yet but I'm sure it will work just as well on the road as at home.

I have bought several in the past but if they had one feature they lacked another. I have two issues: 1) I have very fine thin and curly hair; 2) I travel alot. I needed something that would help me dry my curls with a diffuser on a cool setting (best way to reduce frizz for naturally curly hair) and something that was strong enough to straighten my hair but not so intensely hot that it would damage my fine thin hair. THIS IS IT!!!!! I used a universal diffuser and it fit perfectly even though the dryer is compact and its light enough so that my small hands to get tired when I'm trying to straighten my hair. In true Infinitipro fashion this product is top notch at very reasonable price.

The diffuser fits perfectly on it. It is light weight still and is not unbelievably long like some other styles can be when attached to a diffuser of this magnitude. I have used it twice now. It takes me about 25-30 minutes to get my hair about 75% dry using a combo of low heat. My arms are not super tired after having my head upsidedown and sideways for that amount of time (although I am lazy enough to lean on sinks and doorknobs :-D )

This dryer fits the bill and is a delight to boot.They describe it as a ""mini pro"". It is larger than the travel dryers I've used in the past -- both the folding and just micro mini styles. But it also has more power -- those other dryers either never get warm, don't have enough air flow to dry your hair, or have incredibly short lives due to the bendable/movable parts. This dryer is also smaller than my normal home dryer but it certainly could suffice as one, especially if you have arm strength issues or just want to have a lighter dryer. There are two air speeds -- down for low and up for high. The low has a subtle rumble/hum to it, the high is quieter than my full size dryer. Both give the air flow I would expect. The temperature control is on the handle above that and I find it a bit odd -- cold in the middle, warm down and high up. I don't know why they didn't just do cold - warm - cool like most other dryers. The temperatures were also as I would expect. There is a cold blast button . . . I did try it and it worked fine although I don't usually use it. Just as easy to move the heat switch.Care is normal for hair dryers - keep it clean and keep the vents clear.I am just thrilled with this dyer and it is a great little workhorse which has a permanent position in my gym bag. If it lasts as long as my other Conair dryers I will be thrilled!"

It may be small in size, but it weighs about the same as my normal size hair dryers. However, if you're not looking for super light-weight hair dryers for traveling, this would be a good choice as well. Keep in mind, though, it doesn't fold. The weight is very ergonomically distributed, too, so that when I am using it I can move it very comfortably in every position.The setting variety is quite impressive. Normally, hair dryers at this price suffer the unfortunate lack of features, such as only having a high medium low setting and no temperature, or not having a cold blow button. This dryer has it ALL: cold button, three temperature settings, and two fan settings. What more can you ask for? The hot is hot enough but won't burn you unless you keep it at one single spot. The warm setting is really all you need to dry your hair without any risk of over-dryer. The ""cool"" setting is about the same as the cold button, so if you just want cold air you no longer need to hold the cold button the whole time.Even on the low fan setting it's powerful enough for me to dry my shoulder length hair, especially if you don't use the air concentrater. I personally prefer to use the dryer on low, warm, without the concentrater. But even with the attachment on, the overall size is small enough that it's really easy to maneuver the dryer.The fan has a nice hum and I don't personally think it's super loud. It's not a ""quiet"" dryer, but it's really reasonable. The buttons are placed nicely and they are stiff enough (but not hard to move and change settings) they do not at all interfere or get accidentally moved during use.Highly recommended! I think it's going to be my new go-to dryer."

I dry my hair almost fully, then use my brush and the dryer to give it body and a bit of a curl. Just a bit. The concentrator is my new best friend when it comes to getting ready in the morning.Having a removable filter that can be cleaned is a nice touch, too.

It has 3 different heat settings and is very easy to hold and use. It dries pretty quickly and has a very professional look and feel to it. It is also frizz-free as it claims. I have very frizzy naturally curly hair and I don't normally even use hair dryers because of the frizz but this one did a great job with my hair. I'd recommend it for anyone with naturally curly hair.If this review helped you make an informed buying choice please let me know by leaving a Helpful vote.

Makes no sense to me putting rocker switches in the place that the hand grips. My last new hair-dryer was a total PITA because I was constantly turning off or changing the setting accidentally mid-dry because the rocker switches were right under my fingers. This dryer puts them on the back of the hand-grip and they are RECESSED, which means I only very occasionally hit the rockers when using the dryer. I still hit them, but not as often. But I'd like to ask the manufacturers what the heck is wrong with SLIDING switches that almost never, ever get accidentally hit? I have a 25 year old panasonic dryer that has slide switches and in all the time I used it, it got switched off or changed the heat setting like *maybe* half a dozen times because the switches were placed in a great place that you just almost couldn't hit them accidentally, AND they were sliders. WORKED GREAT. And now everything seems to be rockers. I really, really dislike rocker switches on hair-dryers.PMO. Ok, now that little rant is over, this dryer is decent - not great, but ok enough.Lightweight in the hand and has all the heat settings you might need, from no heat (via a separate button) up to singe ur hair.The fan is a bit weaker than I might like - with only two settings the highest setting isn't very high (and why everyone is saying it is ""quiet"" because there is no true ""high"" setting which tends to be louder) and the husband says ""It Sucks"". It takes a bit longer to dry our hair then it did with the old dryer....The handle is at a weird and not totally comfortable angle to the rest of the dryer. If I had long hair that took a really long time to dry this might be an issue, but we have short hair so it isn't so bad for us.I don't like how short the front, discharging ""barrel"" is - the only way to make it a bit longer is to use one of the two, almost identical added extension pieces, and they didn't include just a plain, round barrel end which makes no sense to me. The heating element is just an inch or so from your hair because of this, unless you use one of the two extension pieces, neither of which I like.And as far as the ""ionic"" claim, well, I literally can't tell the difference between the way my hair feels after using this and after using the 25 year old dryer which I know didn't have any ""fancy sounding"" tech in it. I think it is simply a buzz-word that lets them tack a few more dollars on the price-tag.So yeah, not bad but not great either. The only thing I really *like* is the switch placement, and that only because they are recessed, not because of what they are or where they put them.And the slick white surface is nice as it is easy to keep clean, unlike matte surfaces that grab grime and crap.Low-down is, I probably wouldn't buy this again if I needed a dryer in the near future, I would look for something else. There is no pricing info available at the time I write this, but I, personally, wouldn't pay more than $35 for this dryer. I have the HOT TOOLS Signature Series Professional 1875W Ionic Ac Motor Hair Dryer and even though it's rocker switches are more annoying, we prefer using it.If my experience changes, or I have issues with the dryer in an unreasonable period of time, I will be sure to update this review.I do hope you found my opinion useful."

I sometimes have issues with frizz and/or static but thankfully it's a seasonal thing when they air is dry. If you want to treat yourself to a very fine hairdryer without going all the way to the SUPER expensive, this might be your machine. I realize it would be cost prohibitive to a lot of people at $250, but if it's in your price range and you are considering this machine I am here to say it will not disappoint you.The T3 Micro Featherweight 3i Ionic dryer is gorgeous. As this brand usually does it comes in a nice presentation box and has 2 concentrators (1 for drying 1 for styling), these both fit very snug to the machine. You have an off/low/high toggle switch, and a low medium and high toggle switch at the back of the handle. A nice feature you don't see on less expensive machines at the front of the handle you have a push button, *locking*, cool air option. The dryer is indeed lightweight, quiet, sleek looking and dries for my purposes VERY fast. My hair is soft and smooth. On the day I received this machine I actually spilt some water on my jeans- soaking my thigh- so I used the dryer with the concentrator to dry my jeans. Within minutes I was dry again- it's super fast and I didn't burn myself with too high a heat. The cord is a super long length with a velcro keeper for easy storage, but it's so pretty you may want to find a way to keep it out in the open.It's a very nice dryer and I will enjoy using it."

It has a super long, heavy duty cord. The settings are adequate to do everything I need. The heat and air levels are perfect. It does dry my hair faster than other hair dryers, but not quite as fast as my Dyson. This one seems more gentle on my hair though. The heat gets hot enough without being too hot and causing damage. My hair doesnt feel dried out or rough after using it. I love that it is much more quiet than pretty much any dryer ive ever used. Im not constantly turning it off because I think I heard something, or heard a kid yelling for me etc., and it was really nothing. With this dryer I can hear over it. It is a nice manageable size, comfortable to use, the rocker style power and heat settings are placed very well and they do not get accidentally hit while drying my hair. I just wish it came with a diffuser. Thats the only minor complaint I have. I am sure I can get one somewhere, so its not a big deal, but definitely nice to have one come with it. The concentrators are great for getting lift and volume at roots, as well as for straightening your hair."

The pure white color with the gold accents is simple and polished.Like other more expensive hair dryers this uses Ion technology which helps hair to stay healthy, shiny and dry quicker. It s very quiet. As far as speeds- this has two- one that is very low and the other that is high. The low would probably be good for bangs. I plan to use the high speed the majority of the time. The temp gets warm enough to dry my hair without getting hot to the touch. There wasn t a chemical smell when I first used it or after more frequent use. There also wasn t any flickering or power issues.The hair dryer almost feels like it s weighted a certain way. When I first picked it up it felt heavy. Then, when I tilted it back the weight distributed to the back of the hair dryer and it seemed much lighter. It s actually really easy to hold this- not at all tough on my wrist or my arms.The cool shot switch is probably one of my favorite things. It doesn t need to be held down. When you press it down it stays locked until you press it again. I was also pleasantly surprised by how cool it got. I kept catching myself going back to it while drying my hair. I even made my fianc come in the room to feel how good the cold air felt. My only concern, the cool shot switch felt like it was loosening the more I used it.I would have liked if this hair dryer was a little less expensive, but this might be a case where you re getting what you pay for. I should mention, I ve used other hair dryers that were either hotter or faster (none with a better cool shot), but this hair dryer is just the full package."

This is a really nice machine, though. It feels smooth and the airflow is nice and strong, very even. My only real problem with it is that if you want to use a silicone collapsible diffuser on it, the barrel is pretty wide, so you really will have to wrestle it on. I ended up taking the plastic screen off the diffuser and stretching it from the other way, and then putting the screen back on. I feel like I have to be very careful so it won't come back off. It comes with two different concentrators, but no dedicated diffuser of any type. I was able to dry my curls in a short time with the diffuser attachment I bought separately, but I have curly hair and I don't know how well the concentrators would work for that."

While quiet, it delivers a blast of air that quickly dries my thick hair.One of the features of this is that the attachments can lock into either a horizontal or vertical alignment. You snap them in and then they rotate freely until they hit a catch point either straight up an down or straight side to side. The penalty for this is the attachments require quite a bit of muscle to snap on and off. You have to stop whatever you're doing to focus on snapping on the attachment you need. If you never change attachments, this won't matter but if you do take the attachments sometimes, you may find this annoying.I like that all of the controls are toggle switches that are recessed so you don't ever bump them while using the dryer. I love that the cool mode toggles either on or off so you don't have to hold down the button forever.One concern is the rear air inlet is not removable. Instead they tell you to wipe it with a cloth to remove dust. I know sometimes the dirt that builds up gets inside of my dryers and since you can't get to the inside of this one I concern that it will clog up over time. I guess I'll have to see how it does."

Unfortunately, I have not noticed any drastic difference in smoothing the cuticles of my hair as it claims. But the 2 concentrator helps style my hair quicker with target heat/cool air. I usually let my hair air dry, perhaps I will use this more often and may notice the difference after a while. The dryer could have included a 360 rotating base for the cord. The price is quite steep, so I really hope I'll notice less frizz and shinier hair soon..."

Since I've dyed my hair for the last 15 years and style it frequently my air-dryed hair is frazzled and with this blow dryer you'd think I was a hair model!Before purchasing this blowdryer I spent a lot of time researching different kinds of blow dryers. I thought I had to have ionized or tourmaline or ceramic or whatever other fancy word to make my hair shiny, but this one works WONDERS! Very long cord too and so light! I've had mine for over a year now and use it 2-3 times per week without any problems. Only thing is the back has come unscrewed a few times and the screen filter falls out then.

Years ago I had a twin turbo and LOVED IT! So when I had to purchase a new one for work I decided to give it another go. This dryer does not get hot and it takes me way to long to do a blowout. The nozzle constantly flies off and hits the client unless I literally pound it on with my hand. And the worst part is the filter cover in the back also just pops off at the worst times like I'm the middle of a blowout! I have had 2 of my clients hair get stuck. This is completely unacceptable. I have decided to bring my personal Elchim from home to work and will keep the turbo for my personal use (and risk my hair getting stuck) until I decided on a better blowdyer for work. I would not recommend this product unless you don't mind constantly apologizing to clients. Total waste of money! I have had this dryer for less then 2 months. No reason for any of this to be happening.

So for the drier 3 stars customer service via Amazon and the seller 5 stars.Pros: Dries fast, smooth results, nice button position.Cons: Heavy, the wind screen on the back has no cover, just flimsy screen.

It doesn't seem too noisy when on and the volume of air it blows is pretty decent.The overall construction is as you would expect for the price...a glossy smooth plastic outer shell surrounding the internal heating/electrical/mechanical workings. The switch is easy to manipulate into the desired setting: down for low and up for high. The cool shot button allows the hairdryer to ramp up into the high mode but blow out cool air. The filter cover on the end of the hairdryer is easy to remove by twisting off. I prefer this type of filter cover over the hinged version that you cannot run under the sink for a good cleaning. If you ever rinse the filter cover, make sure it is absolutely dry before putting it back on the hairdryer as water and electricity do not mix! On the topic of electricity, the hairdryer also features a GFCI plug in case your bathroom doesn't have a GFCI outlet. This feature trips the power off to your hairdryer in case it comes into contact with water, preventing electrocution.The weight is decent and lightweight, not too heavy to hold while drying your hair. The handle could be a bit more comfortable, but for the money I cannot complain that much.I don't know about durability, but I think it was a decent purchase and very utilitarian."

Its loud enough where I have to stop a conversation because I cant hear the other person. In terms of buttons there is a ""cold"" setting, however I do need to hold it down for cold air. But I will say when blow drying holding the ""cold button "" isn't so bad because the design makes your hand feel snug when you want cold air and holding it down. In terms of light weight and travel I would use it. It is light weight and petty small comparing to my old hair dryer. The back of the hair dryer sucks air in so fast and hard that It sucked in my hair! Ultimately my hair did get caught in the back of the hair dryer and I did have to be extra careful but does it do its job? Yes. The cable isnt long enough when plugging it to an ankels height outlet and bending over is a must. I am 5'2 and it doesn't go passed my head. Luckily I don't have back probelms or else this would be a huge issue. So I would recommend a higher outlet and making sure the back of the hair dryer isnt facing your long hair or it will get caught.

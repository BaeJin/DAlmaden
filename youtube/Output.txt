1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,450
With just over 1.2 million people, Amsterdam is the largest city in The Netherlands,

2
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:26,060
a country most people know as Holland.

3
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:29,670
This multicultural city warmly embraces tourists,

4
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,840
with over 3.5 million people visiting each year.

5
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,930
The Dutch are very tolerant and fun to talk with, and everybody speaks English.

6
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:44,640
The heart of the city is so picturesque that it is like

7
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,360
an historical open-air museum.

8
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:53,040
No wonder that the inner canal district is an internationally protected heritage site.

9
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,760
In the 17th century Amsterdam was a center for world economy

10
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:04,649
and many of the canal houses and old warehouses date from this Golden Age.

11
00:01:04,649 --> 00:01:08,640
Some landmarks, such as the Oude Kerk in the Red Light District

12
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:15,640
even date back to the 13th century.

13
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:20,290
Just a short walk from the Central Station is iconic Dam Square,

14
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:24,320
built nearly 750 years ago.

15
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,049
Its purpose gave the city its name: Amster. Dam.

16
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:34,290
A dam built around the river Amstel to protect it from an inland sea.

17
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,040
The square is dominated by the Royal Palace.

18
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,150
From its windows you can see the National Monument,

19
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:47,090
dedicated to the many Dutch victims of World War II.

20
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:52,060
The Dam also houses Madame Tussauds' wax collection.

21
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:55,070
The impressive wax collection combines humor

22
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:59,030
with an insight into Holland's gripping history.

23
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:02,850
Listen to fragments of Anne Frank's famous diary,

24
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:07,259
or visit her old hiding place to understand what life was like

25
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:12,060
for Jewish families during Nazi occupation.

26
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:17,260
It's not surprising that Europeans call Amsterdam 'The Venice Of The North':

27
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:23,060
No less than 165 canals - crossed by a thousand bridges -

28
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,980
divide the compact city center.

29
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:30,569
Forget about cars, the best way to see the city center is by foot,

30
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:32,489
or, as the Dutch would say:

31
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:35,050
"Just get on your bike!"

32
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:40,650
Alternatively, take the tram across the city to the Museumplein.

33
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:44,690
Art and history lovers insist that you haven't seen Amsterdam

34
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:50,030
if you haven't seen the paintings by the Dutch masters that are on display here.

35
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:55,069
The Rijksmuseum focuses on Dutch painters from the Golden Age.

36
00:02:55,069 --> 00:02:58,920
But don't forget, there are over 1 million other artworks

37
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,050
on display in this museum with 200 rooms.

38
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,620
Located nearby is the Van Gogh Museum,

39
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:10,690
dedicated to a poor but legendary 19th-century painter.

40
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:17,120
Sadly, he didn't live long enough to see his work become world-famous.

41
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,190
Witness the fine art of transforming rough stones

42
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:23,659
into sparkling jewels in the Diamond Museum.

43
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:30,040
For centuries, Amsterdam was the diamond polishing center of the world.

44
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:37,040
A gentle 10-minute stroll northwest brings you to the popular Vondelpark.

45
00:03:38,129 --> 00:03:42,690
On sunny days it bursts into life as locals and tourists alike

46
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:45,069
come here to relax and people watch.

47
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:51,720
If you are a beer lover, make your way over to the old Heineken Brewery.

48
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:57,040
It is the place to sample one of the world's most popular lagers.

49
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,190
Submerge yourself in the interactive Heineken Experience!

50
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:05,900
From the tulip-filled stalls of the Flower Market,

51
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:10,799
follow the broad canal northeast to the Nieuwmarkt.

52
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:17,799
In the old days, Dutch traders used to come here to weigh in their butter and cheese.

53
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:22,530
Leaving the Nieuwmarkt, you can walk through Chinatown to the Central Station,

54
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:25,909
or take a short detour to 'De Wallen',

55
00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:30,090
one of the world's oldest and most famous Red Light Districts.

56
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:34,990
Today, coffee shops and adult emporiums keep the 'anything goes'

57
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,360
spirit of this neighborhood alive.

58
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,509
As evening sets, head to the Leidseplein,

59
00:04:40,509 --> 00:04:44,030
a square that is buzzing with live music and nightlife.

60
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:48,840
After dark, the canal district takes on a romantic air -

61
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:55,840
the perfect backdrop for a moonlit walk before you retreat to your hotel.

62
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,590
There is no other city like Amsterdam.

63
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:03,020
With its seafaring history, charming gabled houses,

64
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,960
remarkable art, and cosmopolitan people-

65
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,120
it is a place that you won't easily forget!

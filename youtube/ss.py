welcome to episode 19 of PV TV where wetalk all things solar on today's episodewe are discussing LG battery LGbatteries LG Chem solar batteries andbefore we do we just wanted to say thankyou to our 200 subscribers that havejoined us on the channel it's great tohave you here and a very excitingannouncement that's actually prompted usto talk about LG batteries and that isbeing awarded this which is that we werethe largest installer sky energy of LGbatteries in Southeast Asia for 2018yeah in fact we installed more batteriesthan the next four companies combinedyeah so a little pat on the back to usbut thank you so much if you boughtabout you from us or she's subscribed tothe channel or supported us in any waynatsu thank you to you we want to talkabout LG batteries today andspecifically why we use a why we love LGbatteries we've used many many differentkinds of batteries and we're not brandloyal here at sky and Utes worth sayingwe use the best products that we canfind to give people their solar orbattery solutions Rus what would you sayis the first reason why we like to useLG batteries and why you think we'vesold so many LG batteries over the past12 months well I think LG has one of thebest ranges of batteries available sowhen I say range I mean in size andvoltage range as well so there's threetypes of battery when it comes toresidential batteries is low voltage andhigh voltage they're not all thatdifferent in terms of what you canexpect to get at them but LG hasarranged to suit either requirement yeahand what would be an advantage in thedisadvantage I guess of high voltage orlow voltage batteries and having mychoice I believe lower voltages arereally good for off-grid and that sortof application what it means for thehome honestly is really not that much ofa difference that we've come across Iwould have installed plenty of highvoltages and plenty of low voltages itseems to be brand specific to an extentyeah so different brands of inverterfavorite yeah saying a high voltage orlow voltage batteries an LG provideroption for both yeah exactly so if youlike your solarjessimae yeah they've got an option forthat if you like the arms or some groansthey've got a different choice exactlyso LG have an option for for pretty muchmore sort of solar setups unmailed Gbattery on high voltage or low voltagewhat else and you talked about the rangeso you've got six point five kilowattsthe battery silent so they actuallystart at a more manageable size somepeople you don't have to start with ahuge battery when going LG yeah goodstart at a six point five and they goall the way up to 13 yeah you know sixpoint five 10 kilowatt hours we'retalking hours each side sorry yeah sosix point five 10 13 and then you caneven double those yeah you have to sixpoint five you can even go with sixpoint five and a 10 I'm using allergiesthat will combine a box it's veryflexible in how you expand on the systemand how you can grow the system which isgreat because not everyone needs a hugeyeah you know 10 13 kilowatt hourbattery some people really need a 6.5and they can spend the money in a 6.6 mydogs being pretty popular as well yeahobviously a lot of people who want tostart with that smaller battery nowabsolutely in terms of the secondadvantage to using LG batteries whatwould you say the second advantage to LGbatteries is they're very available okayif that's a word yeah so there's memorysupply issues they've got a greatsupport support the service teams herein Melbourne Australia and we'reweb-based are there attendee so you canif you're on site if you have issue youcan give actual LG Chem Accorsi I callyou supply or anything for America orChina call the local support team yeahand you can get really good tech supportyeahand when I say available for theirsupply is also really good yeah andthat's important to note because when itcomes to solar batteries probably thebiggest downfall of Tesla is that theyhaven't even had the production processiron out as we've mentioned before sopeople are on these 12 month waitinglists where cuz LG Chem has been aroundfor such a long time making you knowchemical products and eventuallybatteries they've had that thatproduction process lined out so peoplebuying an LG Chem battery can get it thenext week yeah you're not waiting 12months or longerfor a battery so that availability plusthe support that's here for us locallyin Australia is really really good andgives us a lot of confidence whenrecommending lg batteries to people thatnot only will they be taken care of byus but that they'll be taken care of byLG and you know when you spending thatmuch money on a battery you want to makesure that the company that's selling itto you not specifically but LG is goingto be around and they've definitely gotthat reputation yeah that they're gonnabe around for a referral for a while nowthis is really cool this is something Ilearnt the third thing we're going totalk about actually when we caught upwith some of the guys from LG last weekyeah and we were discussing some of theLG products some of the guys from workat LG Chem in Australia and wediscovered that this is a recycleprogram yes which isn't which is awesomeI was blown away what's what's thisrecycle program yeah so the question alot of people are asking is what willhappen to these batteriesthey've all got 10-year warranties andwe want to get 10-15 years out of thembut what is gonna happen in ten yearswhen we start getting rid of them allthey come is their life they go to thelandfill they poison the earth yeahquestionsyeah good questions how would you jumpedon this I'm pretty early yeah andthey've partnered with the recyclingcompany here in Australia enviros streamvery strong and the thing they put up onthe board was something like 95% of thebatteries they can recycle in summary ofthe actual battery so being reallyproactive in how they're gonna recyclethese batteries I'm not sure who elsehas got a recycling program yet yeah thebatteries went to massive for us becausewe don't want to be giving people aproductthat's good for them and good for theearth now and then screws over the kidsyeah we want to make sure it's good foreveryone and for us I mean learning thiswas has just you know given me a wholenew respect to the LG product which Iwas already a big fan of because nowwe're we're looking after all parts ofthe of the puzzle so to speak and notonly looking after the electricity billsnow but also the planet in the futurerecycling those batteries so that that'sreally cool ninety or ninety fivepercent recyclable the LG batteries arenow with that partnership through anIrish stream so yeah that's very coolthe downside to LG batteries I'll saythat if Ican consider this a downside in myexperience of looking at many manydifferent solar batteries is that theydon't have the solar inverter so thebattery inverter built into the batteryyes when you get a Tesla battery or an Nphase battery the battery unit actuallyhas an inverter in it it's very plug inplace you just plug it into essentiallya switchboard yeah turn the thing onit'll automatically draw the power fromyour solar and charge the battery now LGdoesn't have this what LG does havethough in not having that ability is aslight advantage as well which I thinkin that if you're inverted built intothe battery it's the part most likely tofail we're as close with LG batteriesyou have to buy it externally if thatfails within 10 years and the batteriesgot a 15 year life you can just replacethe inverter the battery inverter youdon't have to replace the whole batteryyeah and from experience we knowinverters are one of the most commonthings to fail and it's a solar systemso yeah the fact that you've got likeyou said it's good and it's bad so it'snot as easy to install it's not as easyto just check on your house it's got alittle bit more involved installationwise you have to buy the battery andhave an inverter or by our tree inverterwith the battery but when it comes toservicing and repairs of anything thatcould go wrong you can split it out andso what the problem actually is yeah sothe battery lasts 15 years great and youcan just replace the inverter 10 whichis relatively 10 years 5 years 10 yearswhich is relatively inexpensive thenrather than you know if you've got aTesla the inverters actually built intothat with the battery and if it failsthe question is well do you have toreplace the whole unit and once you turnyour warranty's out you might be kind ofscrewed well no one knows at this stageso that's the thing - worth worththinking about yeah any other thingsyou'd like to talk about LG that solarbatteries are alien I mean I think LGjust do a great job of all the littlethings yeah we've got they support theinstallers they support the end-usersyou know they've got a recyclablerecycling program they've got a flexiblelineup so that's now one thing I thinkthat makes and yeah I'm good it's thatthey've they're looking after all thesmall parts yeah and it's and it's acompany that's had the experience sountil they've been around I mean LG Chemfor almost 80 years 60 years or 80 yearsor something and it comes comes from thequality of the product and well andtruly we are not incentiveby LG to say this we've we've workedwith many many batteries solar batteriesand installed many solar batteriesourselves and found that for the reasonswe've mentioned that we like to use LGonce again thank you so much if you'reone about 200 subscribers means so muchto us that you subscribe to our channelthank you for being a part of this ifyou get any questions about solar andbatteries leave them in the commentsbelow this video and as always we lookforward to answering them for you on thenext
